# List of R Packages used this semester

Copy and paste the following two lines of code into the Console window of R Studio to install the packages you'll need for this course.

`pkgs <- c("aplpack", "arm", "babynames", "boot", "broom", "car", "cowplot", "devtools", "Epi", "faraway", "forcats", "foreign", "gapminder", "GGally", "ggridges", "gridExtra", "Hmisc", "infer", "knitr", "lme4", "magrittr", "markdown", "MASS", "mice", "mosaic", "multcomp", "NHANES", "pander", "psych", "pwr", "qcc", "rmarkdown", "rms", "sandwich", "skimr", "survival", "tableone", "tidyverse", "vcd", "viridis")`

`install.packages(pkgs)`

Note: If you want to install a single package, you can do so by finding the word **Packages** on the right side of your screen. Click on the **Packages** menu to start installing the packages you'll need. Then click **Install**, which will bring up a dialog box, where you can type in the names of the packages that you need. these should be separated by a space or comma. - Be sure to leave the Install dependencies box checked.

1.  Now, go to the **Packages** tab on the right side of your screen, and click on **Update**. Select and install all available updates.

2.  Finally, choose **File ... Quit R** from the top menu, and accept R Studio's request to save your workspace. This will eliminate the need to re-do these steps every time you work in R.
