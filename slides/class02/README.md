## Announcements

### Getting in Touch with Us

1. Email **431-help at case dot edu** to ask almost any questions about the course. This email is followed by all of the TAs and by Professor Love, and will guarantee you the fastest response possible.
    - If you have any special concerns or questions that require only Dr. Love's attention, please email him at `Thomas dot Love at case dot edu`, or speak with him before or after class.
2. **Teaching Assistant Office Hours** begin next Tuesday, 2018-01-23. All of these locations are a few steps from each other, on the ground floor of the Wood Building in the School of Medicine. The schedule is as follows, and this information is always available in the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-syllabus/) and at the bottom of the [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md).

### Deliverables

3. **Roster Check**. An initial course roster is available in [this Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZbTK4ldaex03ez-TSTq7btOW15XOv9J2ZpIbKh0GBYU/edit?usp=sharing). Please visit the Google Doc (you may need to log into Google via CWRU to see it) and verify the information (editing where needed, and adding whatever is missing, especially including the name I should call you.) If you are not on this roster, email Dr. Love, and fill in your information.
4. **Post-Class Minute Paper**. Please fill out [this Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/qfzI3jro5wyi6vEC2) as soon as possible **after** today's class, for some class participation credit, and to provide us with some feedback about how things are going so far. Thanks in advance.
5. Check [the Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md) for your reading assignments and for everything else, including [Homework 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/assignments/hw1), due next Friday 2018-01-26, at 1 PM. 


### Follow-up on Class 01

6. An audio recording of Class 01 [has been posted](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/slides/class01/class01_audio_2018-01-16.mp3). We're still working on reducing the file size without hampering the quality too much. An audio recording of Class 02 will be posted above, when it becomes available.
7. I added some new materials to Chapter 1 of [the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/), describing what plots I would build in real data situations to help decide whether to use normal (t-based) or non-normal (Wilcoxon rank sum-based) analyses in a Table 1. Look in section 1.5.1.

### General Announcements

8. R and R Studio software installation and updates
    - Details on software installation [from 431 are here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431/blob/master/software-installation-431.md). 
    - Be sure to update your R (to 3.4.3 or later) and R Studio (to 1.1.383 or later). 
    - The list of packages you need to install in R Studio is [at this link](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/data-and-code/PACKAGES.MD).
    - More software information is available at the [Data and Code section](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/data-and-code) of this site.
9. Hadley Wickham's [Whole Game Video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/go5Au01Jrvs) with [code and data here](https://github.com/hadley/building-permits) may be of interest. Hadley does a nice job of showing you how people actually do data analysis work, and will remind you of some of the things we do to use the `tidyverse` and R Studio well. 
10. The old [431 Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/) will be online until May. You may be interested in reviewing them, in particular Part C (sections 37-49) for some details we'll run through quickly this term.
