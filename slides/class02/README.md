## Deliverables

1. **Roster Check**. An initial course roster is available at **XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX**. Please enter the Google Doc, and verify the information (adding whatever might be missing.) If you are not on this roster, email Dr. Love, and fill in your information.
2. **Post-Class Minute Paper**. Please fill out **XXXXXthis Google formXXXXXXX** as soon as possible after today's class, for a small amount of class participation credit, and to provide us with some feedback about how things are going so far.

    - Details on software installation [from 431 are here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431/blob/master/software-installation-431.md). 
    - Be sure to update your R (to 3.4.3 or later) and R Studio (to 1.1.383 or later).

    - More software information is available at the [Data and Code section](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/data-and-code) of this site.
8. Hadley Wickham's [Whole Game Video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/go5Au01Jrvs) with [code and data here](https://github.com/hadley/building-permits) may be of interest. Hadley does a nice job of showing you how people actually do data analysis work, and will remind you of some of the things we do to use the `tidyverse` and R Studio well. 
9. The old [431 Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/) will be online until May. You may be interested in reviewing them, in particular Part C (sections 37-49) for some details we'll run through quickly this term.
