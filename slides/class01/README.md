# 432 Spring 2018 Class 01: 2018-01-16

**An audio recording** (.mp3) of Class 1 is now available, above.

There are no presentation slides today. We'll spend the session discussing the course materials, including:

1. The course [web site](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018)
2. The [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-syllabus/), including introductions for our Teaching Assistants
3. The [Assignments and other Deliverables](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/assignments)
4. The [Things we'll Read](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/texts)
5. The [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md)
6. The [List of Topics](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/TOPICS.md) we'll discuss, as planned.
7. [Project 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/tree/master/projects/project1)

and then we'll work through the material in Chapter 1 of the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/).
