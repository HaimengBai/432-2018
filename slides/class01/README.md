# 432 Spring 2018 Class 01: 2018-01-16

There are no presentation slides today. We'll spend the session discussing the course materials, including:

1. The web site
2. The Syllabus
3. The Assignments and other Deliverables
4. Project 1
5. The Course Notes

and we'll spend considerable time working through the material in Chapter 1 of the Course Notes.

I've included a few files related to Chapter 1 of the Course Notes above.
