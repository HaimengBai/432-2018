## Announcements Before Class 03

1. A student in the class requires the help of a note-taker. If you are willing to provide a copy of your in-class notes to a fellow student (and receive a small stipend for this service) then please send `disability at case dot edu`:
    + your name, 
    + the name of the course (PQHS 432/CRSP 432) and 
    + the instructor's name (Thomas Love). **Thank you!**

2. Stuck on how to build categories in Homework 1?
    + You might try the `cut2` function from the `Hmisc` package, or
    + You might try using `case_when` as demonstrated in Chapter 3 of the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/).
