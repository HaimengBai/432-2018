# Potential 432 Topics So Far

This post was developed during 431. I have placed it here for ease of reference as I craft the course. I do not guarantee to stick to this.

My goal, honestly, is to write the course in terms of a series of case studies, and discuss them through the semester. So far, I have three years of past notes and slides, and no desire to use any of them as they are. We'll see what happens between December 15 and January 15.

Topic | Covered in 432?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------:
Two Projects, Short(er) Quizzes, [Minute Papers](http://oncourseworkshop.com/self-awareness/one-minute-paper/), Statistics in Action, Live R demos, Working in Pairs, 431-help, Teaching Assistants, Love-boost as an R package | Definitely the plan.
Better Distribution of Work Throughout the Term | A major goal.
Logistic Regression | Yes
Imputation and analysis with missing values | Yes (sorry this didn't make 431)
Weighted Linear Regression and Robust Linear Regression | Yes
Transforming predictors, polynomial regression, restricted cubic splines | Yes
Approaches other than stepwise AIC and hypothesis tests for variable selection | Yes
C_p and Best Subsets Regression | Yes
How many observations do I need to fit [a linear](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435615000141) or [a logistic model](https://twitter.com/f2harrell/status/936230071219707913) reasonably? | Yes
[Cross Validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwPQHmiJURI) to avoid [Overfitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmEqvD_ov2o) | Yes
Jeff Leek's "[How To Be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist)" | Yes, we'll read it all
Regression models for count data (Poisson, Negative Binomial) | Yes
Regression models for multi-categorical outcomes | Yes
Data Management: Wrangling/Rectangling using the Tidyverse and [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) | Yes
Merging Data Sets, and the notion of Split-Apply-Combine | Yes
Communicating the Results of Statistical Models Well | Yes
Multi-factor ANOVA, designing experiments | Yes
Kaplan-Meier estimator, Cox proportional hazards models | Yes
[Beyond Power Calculations](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/retropower_final.pdf): Gelman's retrodesign function to assess an inference after the fact | Yes (sorry this didn't make 431)
Non-linear regression models | I expect so.
Reading and Critiquing the Code of Other People, Reproducible Examples | I really hope so.
Using GitHub and [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/) for more than we did this term | I really hope so.
Building a Web-Based Presentation of Your Work | I really hope so.
Learning [a little Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) | I really hope so.
P values, Garden of Forking Paths, Registering Your Analyses | I really hope so.
Building a Decent Table 1 without going nuts | I really hope so.
Log-Linear Models for Contingency Tables | I really hope so.
Mixed Effect Models | I really hope so, but we'll see.
Repeated Measures ANOVA | I hope so, but we'll see.
Hierarchical Linear Models | I hope so, but we'll see.
Longitudinal Analysis other than that | Not really, no.
Other Survival Analysis topics | Nope (we have a course in this subject)
Cluster Analysis, Principal Components Analysis | I hope so, but we'll see.
Machine learning methods like the lasso and elastic net | A bit, maybe.
Scraping data from the web | At least one example.
Sensitivity, Specificity, ROC analysis | A bit, maybe
Special Methods for Clinical Trials | Not much outside of experiments
Propensity Scores, Observational Studies, Causal Effects | Just enough to encourage you to take 500
The problem of multiple comparisons and when to worry about it | I don't know.
Sophisticated strategies for simulating in power calculations | I doubt it.
ASA Statement on P values | Probably.
The mathematics behind all of this stuff | As little as possible.
Bayesian statistics | Not a lot, outside of some hierarchical modeling.
Model Matrices, Markov Chains | Nope
Audio-recording of lectures | I hope so. Tech?
Little "lecture" videos about key concepts | From others - sure. From me - tech + time issues.
BART | Maybe?
Other Things That I've Forgotten Here | Probably
