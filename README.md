# 432-2018
This is the home page for the Spring 2018 version of PQHS / CRSP / MPHP 432: Data Science for Biological, Medical and Health Research II, taught by Professor Thomas Love. The course is given on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 to 2:15 PM, in E 321-323 at the School of Medicine (same classroom as 431 this past Fall.)

**NEW** Some advice for what to do before the course begins is found at the bottom of this page.

Those of you wondering when I'm going to post material on the 432 website beyond the basic stuff that's already there, the answer is, not yet, and many things may not arrive until the morning of our first class, on Tuesday January 16. But if you are wondering what you can do in advance to feel better prepared. I can think of four things:

1. Software stuff:
    - a. Get yourself a free GitHub account, and come to the first class prepared to tell me your GitHub user name. We won't need this on Day 1, but it would be helpful.
    - b. Also, update your R (to 3.4.3 or later) and R Studio (to 1.1.383 or later) so you'll be ready to go on the first day. Details on software installation [can be found here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431/blob/master/software-installation-431.md). It is not imperative, but definitely useful to have a laptop that can run R and R Studio in class. 

2. Get a copy of Jeff Leek's book [How to be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist), which you can obtain from LeanPub. The book is about how to be a scientist the modern, open-source way. We're going to read this together over the first half of the semester, but there's nothing stopping you from starting in advance. The sections on Data Sharing and Scientific Code are most directly relevant to this course, so you might start with them.

3. Hadley Wickham's [Whole Game Video](https://youtu.be/go5Au01Jrvs) with [code and data here](https://github.com/hadley/building-permits) may be of interest. Hadley does a nice job of showing you how people actually do data analysis work, and will remind you of some of the things we do to use R Studio well. The first days of 432 will involve me doing some live work, with your help, as well.

4. If you didn't take 431 with me this past Fall and even if you did, you'll probably want to look at [the Course Notes from last term](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/) as a review, in particular Part C (sections 37-49.)
