# Texts for 432, Spring 2018

The two key books we're reading this semester are:

- Jeffrey Leek [How to be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist), which we'll read in its entirety. Buy an electronic copy at [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist). The book is about how to be a scientist the modern, open-source way.
    - The schedule for reading this book is outlined in [the Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md), but feel free to just read the whole thing in order if you prefer.
- Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), which we'll read excerpts from. 
    - An electronic copy is available [at this link](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), or you can buy the book [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1515951123&sr=8-3&keywords=r+for+data+science) if you prefer a paperback copy.
    - I assume you havbe already read Sections 1-10 and 15 in 431, so if you haven't, you'll want to do that before the end of February.

Other required and recommended materials coming here as the semester progresses.
