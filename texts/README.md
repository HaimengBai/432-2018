# Texts for 432, Spring 2018

The two key books we're reading this semester (see [the Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md) for assigned dates) are:

- (**Leek**) Jeffrey Leek [How to be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist), which we'll read in its entirety. Buy an electronic copy at [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist). The book is about how to be a scientist the modern, open-source way.
- (**R4DS**) Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), which we'll read excerpts from. 
    - An electronic copy is available [at this link](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), or you can buy the book [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1515951123&sr=8-3&keywords=r+for+data+science) if you prefer a paperback copy.
    - I assume you already read **Sections 1-12 and 15** of this book in 431, so if you haven't, you'll want to do that before the end of February.
    - This term, we'll read Part IV (Model) and Part V (Communicate), before the first project is due in March.

Other required and recommended materials coming here as the semester progresses.
