## Question 1. (20 points)

Consider the `hbp330` data used in Homeworks 1 and 2. In question 4 of HW2, you built a model for the prediction of body-mass index, considering the following 14 predictors: `practice`, `age`, `race`, `eth_hisp`, `sex`, `insurance`, `income`, `hsgrad`, `tobacco`, `depdiag`, `sbp`, `dbp`, `statin` and `bpmed`. Your task now is to fit a Spearman rho-squared plot to identify the candidate variables on which you might most reasonably try to address non-linearity in a model predicting body-mass index, now making use of as much of the data set that missing data allow. Which variables are most appealing candidates to add non-linear evaluations to a linear fit to the complete set of 14 predictors, and why? Be sure to show the plot, provide a written explanation of your conclusions about it, and specify the variables that are most appealing for non-linear augmentations, all in complete sentences.
